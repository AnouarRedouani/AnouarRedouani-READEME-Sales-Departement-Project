# Sales Forecasting Project

## Overview
In this project, we aim to predict future sales based on historical data using machine learning techniques. The project consists of several key steps to guide the process from data exploration to model refinement.

## Key Steps

### 1. Understanding the Problem and Business Case
We will start by defining the use case and the problem of sales forecasting, highlighting the importance of artificial intelligence and machine learning in helping companies optimize their performance.

### 2. Importing Libraries and Datasets
In this step, we will import the necessary libraries and load relevant datasets for our analysis.

### 3. Exploring and Analyzing the Data
We will examine the data using visualization and analytical techniques to better understand trends and sales patterns.

### 4. Using Facebook Prophet
We will apply the Facebook Prophet tool, developed by Facebookâ€™s data science team, to forecast future sales. This tool is particularly effective in handling seasonal effects and demand fluctuations.

### 5. Refining the Model
After training our initial model, we will enhance it by incorporating additional factors such as holiday effects and seasonality to improve accuracy.

### 6. Model Training and Evaluation
We will train our model on historical data and evaluate its performance, ensuring that it accurately predicts future sales.

### 7. Applications and Insights
Finally, we will discuss how the insights gained from this project can be applied in real-world scenarios, such as optimizing inventory management and launching targeted advertising campaigns.

## Expected Outcomes
This project will provide valuable experience in predictive modeling and data analysis, allowing us to leverage historical data to make informed business decisions.
